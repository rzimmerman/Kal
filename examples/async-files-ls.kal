# This demo prints out the name and size of each
# file in the user's home directory. It retrieves
# the file listing and size asynchronously using
# a standard for loop.

fs = require 'fs'
path = require 'path'

# `print` is just an alias for `console.log`
print 'Reading files...'

# asynchronous call to readdir
wait for file_list from fs.readdir process.env.HOME

# execution resumes when the API function calls back with a result
for file_name in file_list

  # an async call within a loop works like you'd expect
  wait for stats from fs.stat path.join(process.env.HOME, file_name)
  print file_name, stats.size
print 'Done!'
