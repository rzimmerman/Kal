Literate Kal
------------

This file translates Literate Kal files to regular Kal files for the compiler. Literate Kal files are [Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files with embedded code blocks that contain Kal code. All code blocks (denoted by four leading spaces) are treated as source code while all other Markdown is translated to comments.

    function translate(literate_code)

This function reads the Literate code line by line, building a new array of non-Literate (illiterate?) code.

      regular_kal_lines = []
      last_line = ''
      in_code_block = no

if the source comes from a <textarea> (or windows) the lines will end with \r\n. Let's remove the \r before split \n

      for line in literate_code.replace(/\r/g, '').split '\n'  

If the line starts with four spaces and the previous line was blank or code, we keep the line but remove the spaces. Otherwise, we prepend a `# ` comment marker to make it a comment.

        if /^   /.test(line) and (last_line is '' or in_code_block)
          in_code_block = yes
          regular_kal_lines.push line.slice 4
        else
          in_code_block = no
          regular_kal_lines.push '# ' + line
        last_line = line

The translated code is standard Kal.

      return regular_kal_lines.join '\n'

    exports.translate = translate
